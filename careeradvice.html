    <h1>Career Advice</h1>

    <p>
      Building a successful career isn't just about scoring marks or getting a degree—it's about developing the right mindset, building relevant skills, and staying consistent with your efforts. Whether you’re a fresher or a final-year student, the choices you make today will shape your future.
    </p>

    <h2>🎯 Set Clear Career Goals</h2>
    <p>
      Don’t wait till the last semester to think about your career. Set short-term and long-term goals. Ask yourself what kind of job you’d enjoy, which industries excite you, and where you see yourself in the next 3–5 years. It’s okay if the path is unclear at first—what matters is starting the journey.
    </p>

    <h2>📚 Study Smart, Not Just Hard</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Understand concepts:</strong> Don’t memorize blindly. Focus on truly understanding the subject—it helps in interviews and real-world work.</li>
      <li><strong>Make notes:</strong> Maintain short, to-the-point notes to revise before exams or interviews.</li>
      <li><strong>Use the 80/20 rule:</strong> Focus 80% of your energy on the 20% of topics that give the most results (important concepts, past papers, etc.).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>⏳ Time Management is Everything</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Make a simple daily plan. Even allocating just 2 hours a day to career goals can do wonders.</li>
      <li>Use tools like Google Calendar or Notion to stay organized.</li>
      <li>Avoid distractions. Limit time spent on social media during productive hours.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💼 Do Internships Early</h2>
    <p>
      Internships are one of the best ways to gain experience, explore industries, and build your confidence. Even unpaid internships can add valuable experience and boost your resume. Start as early as your first or second year if possible.
    </p>

    <h2>🛠️ Build Skills and Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pick relevant skills:</strong> If you're into tech, learn programming, data structures, or web development. If you're into marketing, learn tools like Canva, Meta Ads, or Google Analytics.</li>
      <li><strong>Create personal projects:</strong> Projects show practical application of your skills. They also give you content for resumes and interviews.</li>
      <li><strong>Document your journey:</strong> Share what you learn on LinkedIn. It builds your profile and helps recruiters notice you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🌐 Build a Professional Network</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Connect with alumni and industry professionals on LinkedIn.</li>
      <li>Attend webinars, workshops, and student communities to grow your circle.</li>
      <li>Don’t hesitate to ask for guidance—people are more helpful than you think.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📄 Resume & LinkedIn Optimization</h2>
    <p>
      Keep your resume simple and focused. Highlight projects, internships, and skills. Use action verbs. Ensure your LinkedIn profile is complete with a clear headline, summary, and updated experience section.
    </p>

    <h2>💬 Take Feedback Seriously</h2>
    <p>
      Whether it’s from peers, mentors, or interviewers—constructive criticism can help you grow faster. Always be open to learning and improving.
    </p>

    <h2>🚀 Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      There’s no single way to succeed—but consistent effort always beats shortcuts. Keep learning, stay curious, and remember: your career is a marathon, not a sprint. Don’t compare your journey with others—build your own path with passion and patience.
